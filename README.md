# Caption-Craft
Caption Craft is a Flask web app that generates descriptive captions for images using a deep learning model trained on the Flickr8k dataset. It combines a pre-trained ResNet50 for image features with an LSTM-based RNN for sequence generation. The project showcases transfer learning and RNNs for image captioning.
